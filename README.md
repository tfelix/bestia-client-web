## Discontinued

This client is not under active development anymore. There is the new 3D client which enabled me to get closer
to my vision of the perfect MMORPG. Check it out from [bestia-client](https://github.com/tfelix/bestia-client)!

## Development

We use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) as the build system. In order to build and run the client just checkout the repo
and do:

```bash
npm install && npm run dev
```

inside the main folder.

The game is build using an entity component system. The components are meant to be updated by the server in the future
and are rendered during the update steps in the main loop.

## Contributing

Contribution is quite simple, there is no Contributing Guide yet. The main points are:

* Found a bug? Report it on GitHub Issues and include a code sample.
* Before submitting a Pull Request run your code through TS Lint using our config and keep the coding style already present.

## Art Assets

The licences of all artwork content used in this project can be found in the [ASSETS.md](ASSETS.md) file.
Great care was taken to only include artworks and assets with permissive licences. If you think there is a problem please

Created with :heart: by [Thomas Felix](https://tfelix.de).

The idea of this game is in my mind since 2006. It was meant as a little browsergame meant to be played by my highschool
class. Sadly it never came to a state I was satisfied with.

The first Alpha version screenshots looked like this and came from the release around 2009:

![Bestia Overview Screen](https://bestia-game.net/user/data/images/github/bestia_overview.jpg "Bestia Overview Screen")
![Inventory](https://bestia-game.net/user/data/images/github/inventory.jpg "Bestia Inventory")
![Moving Bestia in the overworld](https://bestia-game.net/user/data/images/github/move.jpg "Moving Bestia in Overview World")

Since then there was pause in development until I dreamed about new game mechanics and was complelty fed up with todays
MMORPGs. The idea of Bestia was renewed and development began to speed up again in 2016.
